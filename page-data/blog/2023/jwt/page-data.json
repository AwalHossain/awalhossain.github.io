I can still remember how terrified I was that day. I was telling myself what the hell is this new thing that I need to implement in order to verify the user and api.\n\nHowever, after working on a few projects, I feel forced into making this statement\n\n> Jwt token is an excellent approach to validate any user against a database.\n\n>\n\n**What is jwt token??**\n\nJwt is an abbreviation for Json Web Token. A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner/user. It’s encoded. When a server receives a JWT, it can guarantee the data it contains can be trusted because it’s signed by the source. No middleman can modify a JWT once it’s sent.\n\n**Creating JWT token**\n\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0p7aa68qzatt0b4jp1j.png)\n\nIf you take a look at the above picture closely, you will get an idea how developers generate the jwt token.\n\nWhen a developer creates a JWT token with a method called jwt.sign(), it contains elements such as the user id, JWT_SECRET, and expiration date. JWT_SECRET helps to make a sign token that won't work anywhere unless the secret is given. The expiration date will determine how long this token will be valid.\nAfter successfully generating a jwt token, All you have to do now is transmit the jwt token to the frontend and save it in localstorage or Cookie.\n.\n\n**How does JWT Token work ?**\n\n![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c96pmydcjiy73q12cxpu.png)\n\nLet's have a look at how it works now. Let's say you need to access your data from the dashboard, but how will that website validate your identity and prevent a hacker from gaining access to your information?\n\nSimply said, the provided jwt token will be checked against the database.\nIf that website discovers a user id associated with the jwt token, it will grant you access to the dashboard.\n\nSo, I used the jwt.verify() function, which accepts two parameters: token and JWT SECRET, to check the jwt token. It will allow you to enter if both input values are true.\n\nTake a look at the above picture to better understand.\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2023/jwt/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/awalhossain.github.io/awalhossain.github.io/src/posts/2023/jwt/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"All About JWT Token","summary":"The concept of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), a method used to verify users in web development.
