It allows users to upload videos, which are then processed and converted into multiple bitrates for adaptive streaming. The application follows a microservices architecture and uses various technologies like RabbitMQ (message broker), Socket.IO (real-time communication), FFmpeg (video processing), and BullMQ (job queues).\n\n<div\nstyle={{\n  display:\"flex\",\n  justifyContent:\"space-between\",\n  alignItems:\"center\",\n}}\n>\n<div\nstyle={{\n  display:\"flex\",\n  justfyContent:\"center\",\n  alignItems:\"center\",\n}}\n>\n<button style={{ \n  backgroundColor: 'gray',\n  border: 'none',\n  color: 'white',\n  padding: '8px 14px',\n  textAlign: 'center',\n  textDecoration: 'none',\n  display: 'inline-block',\n  fontSize: '16px',\n  margin: '4px 2px',\n  borderRadius: '5px',\n  cursor: 'pointer',\n}}>\n<a href=\"https://www.reely.tech/\" style={{\n  textDecoration: 'none',\n  textUnderlineOffset: 'none',\n  color: 'white',\n}}>Demo</a>\n</button>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<button style={{ \n  backgroundColor: 'gray',\n  border: 'none',\n  color: 'white',\n  padding: '8px 14px',\n  textAlign: 'center',\n  textDecoration: 'none',\n  display: 'inline-block',\n  fontSize: '16px',\n  margin: '4px 2px',\n  borderRadius: '5px',\n  cursor: 'pointer',\n}}>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AwalHossain/video-streaming-client\" style={{\n  textDecoration: 'none',\n  textUnderlineOffset: 'none',\n  color: 'white',\n}}>Client</a>\n</button>\n\n<button style={{ \n  backgroundColor: 'gray',\n  border: 'none',\n  color: 'white',\n  padding: '8px 14px',\n  textAlign: 'center',\n  textDecoration: 'none',\n  display: 'inline-block',\n  fontSize: '16px',\n  margin: '4px 2px',\n  borderRadius: '5px',\n  cursor: 'pointer',\n}}>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AwalHossain/video-streaming-server\" style={{\n  textDecoration: 'none',\n  textUnderlineOffset: 'none',\n  color: 'white',\n}}>Server</a>\n</button>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n![Project Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/qDT7gDh/diagram-export-5-27-2024-2-41-36-PM.png)\n\n\n\n## üåê Overview \n\nThe video streaming service aims to provide a smooth experience for users to upload, process, and stream videos with adaptive bitrate streaming. It tackles challenges like video processing, concurrency issues, and microservices integration by using modern technologies and architectural patterns.\n\n\n\n\n## üåü Features\n\n- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Videos are converted into multiple bitrates, allowing users to stream at the highest quality based on their network conditions.\n- **Real-time Video Processing**: Uploaded videos are processed in real-time, converting them to MP4 format and generating multiple HLS bitrate streams using FFmpeg.\n- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is built with a decoupled microservices architecture for scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.\n- **Message Queue Integration**: RabbitMQ is used as a message broker to enable communication between microservices, facilitating asynchronous processing and real-time progress tracking.\n- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Users receive real-time notifications and progress updates throughout the video processing workflow by RabbitMQ then pass the progress and notification to the Client side using Socket.IO.\n- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Processed video files are stored in Azure Blob Storage for efficient serving and scalability.\n\n\n## üèóÔ∏è Architecture\n\n![Project Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/YQtr0yh/Untitled-2024-05-10-2008.png)\n\n\n## The microservices architecture consists of three main components:\n\n#### üñ•Ô∏è API Server\n\n Handles authentication, API requests, and manages video and user metadata in MongoDB.\n\n#### üéûÔ∏è Video Processing Service\n\nProcesses videos in real-time, converts them to adaptive bitrates using FFmpeg, and stores processed files in Azure Blob Storage.\n\n\n1. Converts any format video into MP4 and applies a watermark if an image is provided.\n\n2. Bitrate Processing: Transforms the video into adaptive bitrate HLS format (480p & 1080p) for optimal streaming quality.\n\n3. CDN Upload: Upon successful conversion, the video is uploaded to a CDN bucket storage. This allows users to stream videos seamlessly from anywhere in the world.\n\n4. BullMQ BullMQ manages the job queue, passing one job to the next upon completion, with job data stored in Redis. Please note that this service is not exposed to any HTTP port, ensuring a secure video processing pipeline.\n\n### üì° Api-Gateway\nActs as a gateway between the frontend and backend services, routing requests and facilitating communication through RabbitMQ.\n\nThe microservices communicate with each other using RabbitMQ as an asynchronous message broker and, in some cases, HTTP requests. The API gateway communicates with the frontend using Socket.IO for real-time updates and progress tracking.\n\n### Challenges and Solutions\n\n\n\n1. **Message Queue Setup**: Setting up the internal message queue (RabbitMQ) was challenging due to the multi-step nature of video conversion. BullMQ was implemented to facilitate communication between each step. BullMQ worker supposed to triggered by a notification but the worker wasn't getting triggered even though notification received successfully, later i found out my redis storage closed because of to many delayed jobs and also using the same redis storage for other services, and it was making my worker not triggered\n\n\n2. **Adaptive Bitrate Conversion**: Converting mp4 vidoe into multiple hls bitrate was another difficult job, cause there wasn't enough article or info using nodejs to convert video into bitrate streaming, so i had to go through immense amount of testing and trying \n\n3. **Microservices & RabbitMQ Integration**: Microservices setup and RabbitMQ integration presented concurrency problems, leading to video file mixing during simultaneous uploads. i had to go through each of the steps to find out what was the issue causing the mixing of video file with one another and it took lot of time to fix this problem\nlater i found out that after downloading each video, from the cloud, server asynchronously passing the video metadata to the bullMQ and it was causing the mixing, and then i've applied asyn mutex to pause the asynchronous behavior, though it casuses little bit delay but it fixed video file mixing problem\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Implement advanced video analytics and recommendations.\n- Enhance security features, such as video encryption and access control.\n- Improve scalability by leveraging cloud-native technologies.\n- Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance.\n- Incorporate machine learning for intelligent video transcoding and bitrate optimization.\n\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [FFmpeg Documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html)\n- [RabbitMQ Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html)\n- [Socket.IO Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)\n- [BullMQ Documentation](https://docs.bullmq.io/)\n\n\n\n## üìù Note\n\nThis project is still under development.
