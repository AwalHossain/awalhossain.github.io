 ## Technical Highlights

✅ **Modern Frontend Stack**: Harnessed React's component-based architecture and unidirectional data flow for a modular and scalable single-page application (SPA).<br />

✅ **TypeScript Integration**: Implemented TypeScript for enhanced code maintainability, better tooling, and improved developer productivity.<br />
✅ **Express Server**: Constructed an Express server on the Node.js runtime environment, leveraging middleware design patterns for modular routing and controller logic.<br />
✅ **NoSQL Database**: Composed a MongoDB document-oriented database for flexible data schemas and rapid prototyping, facilitated by Mongoose for schema validation and community support.<br />
✅ **Transaction Management**: Employed Mongoose transactions to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) when updating user preferences across multiple collections.<br />
✅ **Component Composition**: Decomposed the user interface into smaller, reusable components for better code organization and maintainability.<br />
✅ **State Lifting**: Implemented state lifting to manage user preferences efficiently across multiple components.<br />
